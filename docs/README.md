# Angular _ngrx-data_ Overview

The _ngrx-data_ library makes it easier to write an Angular application that manages [entity](faq.md#entity) data with 
[ngrx](faq.md#ngrx) in a "reactive" style, following the [redux](faq.md#redux) pattern.

See the [README.md](../readme.md) for instructions on installing the library and running the demo app.
